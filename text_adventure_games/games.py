        There are three main parts to this method:

        1. Create skeletons for all characters and locations. Currently, items
           exist by being in a location or a character's inventory, and so this
           step also creates item skeletons. See the from_primitive methods for
           characters and locations for more.
        2. Replace fields in skeletons where an object's name exists with the
           actual objects. This step replaces fields where an object's name is
           stored instead of the actual object.
        3. Instantiate anything left that requires full object instances to
           work properly. Blocks require actual instances for everything.

        Once those steps are done, this method simply adds any remaining game
        fields to the game instance.
